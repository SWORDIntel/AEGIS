# Aegis Protocol: Future Tasks & Roadmap

The current MVP provides an excellent visual and interactive concept. The next phases will focus on integrating real blockchain functionality and building out the arbiter system.

## Phase 1: Core Monero Integration (The True Technical MVP)

1.  `[〰️]` **Real Monero Key Management (Client-Side):** (UI for mock mnemonic generation/backup and user education present in AccountModal)
    *   `[〰️]` Secure generation of Monero mnemonic seeds. (Mock generation UI exists)
    *   `[ ]` Derivation of private/public view and spend keys. (Mock strings displayed)
    *   `[ ]` Secure local encrypted storage of private keys (e.g., using browser's Web Crypto API with a user-derived password).
    *   `[〰️]` Implement robust UI for key backup (displaying mnemonic) and restoration. (UI for backup exists; no restoration UI)
    *   `[✔️]` Provide extensive user education on the critical importance of self-custody and key security. (Warnings in AccountModal)
2.  `[〰️]` **Monero Full Node Interaction:** (UI for node URL configuration present in AccountModal)
    *   `[✔️]` Allow users to configure connection to their own Monero full node (local or remote RPC). (Input field in AccountModal)
    *   `[ ]` Implement functions to:
        *   Query blockchain height and sync status.
        *   Check wallet balance (view-only initially).
        *   Scan for incoming/outgoing transactions relevant to the user.
3.  `[〰️]` **2-of-3 Multi-Signature Address Generation:** (Mock multi-sig address displayed in EscrowDetailPage)
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to generate Monero 2-of-3 multi-signature addresses using the public keys of the buyer, seller, and the assigned arbiter.
    *   `[〰️]` Securely display and manage these multi-sig details within the escrow. (Mock address displayed)
4.  `[〰️]` **Transaction Construction & Broadcasting (Funding):** (UI buttons in EscrowDetailPage simulate funding by changing local state)
    *   `[ ]` Develop functionality to construct Monero transactions for funding the multi-sig address.
    *   `[ ]` Guide users through signing these transactions using their locally stored private spend key.
    *   `[ ]` Broadcast signed transactions to the Monero network via the connected node.
    *   `[ ]` Implement monitoring for transaction confirmations.
5.  `[〰️]` **Transaction Construction & Broadcasting (Release/Refund/Split):** (UI buttons in EscrowDetailPage simulate resolution by changing local state)
    *   `[ ]` Develop logic to construct Monero transactions for releasing funds from the multi-sig address according to the resolution (agreement or arbiter decision).
    *   `[ ]` This requires a mechanism for two of the three parties (Buyer, Seller, Arbiter) to contribute their signatures. This is a complex step involving secure exchange or aggregation of partial signatures.
6.  `[〰️]` **On-Chain Time-Locks (Research & Implementation):** (UI button in EscrowDetailPage simulates timelock expiry by changing local state)
    *   `[ ]` Thoroughly research Monero's capabilities for time-locked transactions (e.g., `nLockTime` if applicable to multi-sig, or alternative constructions).
    *   `[ ]` Implement the chosen mechanism to enforce default outcomes if a dispute timer expires. This is a significant cryptographic challenge.

## Phase 2: Arbiter System - Backend & Basic Operations

1.  `[ ]` **Secure Arbiter Backend Application:**
    *   `[ ]` Develop a dedicated, secure server application (e.g., using Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Go) for arbiters.
    *   `[ ]` Implement arbiter authentication.
    *   `[ ]` Secure storage and management of arbiters' private keys (for their part of the multi-sig).
    *   `[ ]` API endpoints for:
        *   Listing assigned disputes.
        *   Retrieving escrow details and evidence (initially, links or text summaries).
        *   Submitting their signed portion of a resolution transaction.
2.  `[〰️]` **Initial Arbiter Pool & Assignment:** (Mock arbiter ID concept used; simulated arbiter actions in EscrowDetailPage)
    *   `[ ]` Begin with a small, pre-vetted list of trusted arbiters managed centrally.
    *   `[ ]` Implement a simple mechanism for assigning new disputes (e.g., round-robin, or admin assignment).
3.  `[〰️]` **Secure Arbiter-Party Communication (If Needed):** (General chat log exists in EscrowDetailPage; no specific arbiter-only channel)

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features, Security & Decentralization

1.  `[〰️]` **Evidence System with Cryptographic Proofs:** (Chat messages can be marked "isEvidence" in UI; no actual cryptographic proofs)
    *   `[ ]` Implement client-side generation of Merkle proofs for chat log segments or uploaded files.
    *   `[ ]` Enable arbiters to verify these proofs without needing the entire dataset.
2.  `[ ]` **Decentralized Arbiter Network (Long-Term Vision):**
    *   `[ ]` Design and implement staking mechanisms (requiring arbiters to lock XMR as collateral).
    *   `[ ]` Develop a robust arbiter reputation system (on-chain or cryptographically verifiable off-chain).
    *   `[ ]` Create an economic model for arbiter fee distribution and slashing for malicious behavior.
    *   `[ ]` Explore decentralized dispute assignment algorithms.
3.  `[〰️]` **User Reputation System:** (Mock `reputationScore` in `UserProfile` displayed in AccountModal)
    *   `[ ]` Based on successfully completed escrows and dispute outcomes, develop a basic reputation score for users.
4.  `[✔️]` **Tor Integration (Client Application):** (Conceptual toggle `useTor` in AccountModal settings)
5.  `[ ]` **(Optional) Atomic Swaps / Cross-Chain Support:**
    *   `[ ]` For BTC/LTC to XMR deposits:
        *   `[ ]` Option 1: Integrate with trusted third-party swap services (clearly outlining counterparty risks).
        *   `[ ]` Option 2: Research and implement atomic swap protocols (highly complex).
6.  `[✔️]` **UI/UX Refinements:** (The app has a well-developed conceptual UI/UX)
    *   `[〰️]` Continuously improve based on user testing and feedback.
    *   `[〰️]` Enhance error handling, particularly for complex Monero operations. (Basic notifications exist; not for non-existent Monero ops)
    *   `[〰️]` Provide more in-app guidance and educational material. (Some guidance in AccountModal, footer, tooltips)
7.  `[✔️]` **Notifications:** (Implemented in `NotificationArea.tsx` and used for UI events)

## Phase 4: Security, Audits, and Mainnet Preparation

1.  `[ ]` **Rigorous Security Audits:**
2.  `[ ]` **Formal Verification (If Applicable):**
3.  `[ ]` **Penetration Testing:**
4.  `[ ]` **Comprehensive Testnet Trials:**
5.  `[ ]` **Legal & Regulatory Review:**

## Ongoing Tasks

*   `[〰️]` **Documentation:** (This ROADMAP.md file, code comments)
*   `[ ]` **Community Building:** (Not applicable to code)
*   `[ ]` **Support Infrastructure:** (Not applicable to code)
*   `[ ]` **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** (Not applicable to code)
*   `[〰️]` **Code Refactoring & Performance Optimization.** (Code is reasonably structured)

This roadmap outlines a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey to bring the Aegis Protocol from a conceptual MVP to a fully functional, secure, and decentralized escrow system. Each phase builds upon the last, incrementally adding real value and security.
